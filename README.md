In this guided project, you'll learn how to build your own AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, your personal assistant will use voice. You will use Watson Speech-to-Text to give your AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that your assistant can read the answers back to you.

A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.
